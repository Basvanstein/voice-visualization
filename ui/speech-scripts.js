		`When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a

	its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
	People look, but no one ever finds it.`,

	'Please call stella':
		`Please call Stella.  
	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store:  
	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, 
	and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
	She can scoop these things into three red bags, 
	and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.`,

	'Phonetic Pangram: Quick beige fox...':

	'Phonetic Pangram: Waters of the loch':
		`The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all,

	'Emily Dickinson: Afraid to own a body':
		`I am afraid to own a Body—
		I am afraid to own a Soul—

		Upon an unsuspecting Heir—
		Duke in a moment of Deathlessness
		And God, for a Frontier.`,

	'Emily Dickinson: Rearrange a "Wife\'s" affection': 
		` Rearrange a "Wife's" affection!
		When they dislocate my Brain!
		Amputate my freckled Bosom!

		Blush, my unacknowledged clay --
		Seven years of troth have taught thee
		More than Wifehood every may!`,

	'Rita Dove: Trans-':
		`The moon is in doubt
		over whether to be
		a man or a woman.

		There've been rumors,
		all manner of allegations,
		bold claims and public lies:

		When he fades, the world teeters.
		When she burgeons, crime blossoms.

		O how the operatic impulse wavers!
		Dip deep, my darling, into the blank pool.`,
	
	'Kalonymus: Even Bochan': 
		`Oh, but had the artisan who made me
		created me instead — a fair woman. 
		Today I would be wise and insightful.
		We would weave, my friends and I,
		and in the moonlight spin our yarn, 
		and tell our stories to one another, 
		from dusk till midnight.`,
	
	'Edgar Allan Poe: Alone':
		`From childhood's hour I have not been
		As others were -- I have not seen
		As others saw -- I could not bring
		My passions from a common spring --
		From the same source I have not taken
		My sorrow -- I could not awaken
		My heart to joy at the same tone --
		And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --`
