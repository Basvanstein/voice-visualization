	'Rainbow Passage': 
		`When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a 
	prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into 
	many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with 
	its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
	People look, but no one ever finds it.`,
